A lot of classic and robust technologies like MySQL and Memcached and some other that was developped by Twitter like Zipkin and Scalding.</li><li><a href="http://thecodeplayer.com/" target="_blank">The code player</a> : a very cool website showing how to create effects from scratch using html 5, css 3, Javascript... For example : <a href="http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/make-an-accordian-style-slider-in-css3" target="_blank">how to make an accordian style slider in CSS3 ?</a></li><li><b>Javascript</b>: a collection of <a href="http://jsbooks.revolunet.com/" target="_blank">JavaScript book</a> to learn a lot of things about Javascript, CoffeeScript...</li><li><b>RSS</b>: I love RSS feed, I find that it is a convenient way to learn things and be notified when new article are posted without having to go to that site every hour. But sometimes the RSS feed is uncomplete. That site can help you : <a href="http://fulltextrssfeed.com/" target="_blank">Full text RSS feed.</a> I can not live without it !</li></ul><br />That's all for this time, folks !</div>

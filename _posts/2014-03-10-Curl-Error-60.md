excerpt: curl error 60 ? Solved !

Last week I had a hard time when trying to integrate an old version of a [Crowd Connector](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CROWD021/Integrating+Crowd+with+Apache) because I was always getting an error 60 when that connector tried to contact a Crowd Server.

After 10' seconds of Googling I found that error 60 for curl means:

    Peer certificate cannot be authenticated with known CA certificates.

Great ! How can I solve that ?

Unfortunately curl is bundled into the Crowd Connector and it was impossible for me to pass a parameter to specify my CA (this parameter is available in version 2.7 of the connector).

The solution is to add your server CA to the system-default bundle. In RedHat it's in `/etc/pki/tls/certs`:

    cat my_ca.pem >> /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt

And voil√† ! No more issue
